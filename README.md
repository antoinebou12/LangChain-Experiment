# LangChain-Experiment

LangChain-Experiment is a project that aims to explore various capabilities of the LangChain library with different AI models like OpenAI's GPT-3 and LlamaCPP. The project involves implementing different language models to perform various tasks such as text analysis, code understanding, querying data, summarization, extraction, and more.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/LangChain-Experiment.git
cd LangChain-Experiment
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Roadmap

1. Integration of more AI models (GPT-4, Codex, etc.).
2. Implementation of caching to improve performance.
3. Enhancements in the user interface for better interaction.
4. Exploration of more use cases (Chatbots, API interactions, etc.).
5. Comprehensive error handling and logging for better debugging.

## ToDo

- [ ] Integrate caching in the application.
- [ ] Test the application with various use cases.
- [ ] Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for the application.
- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging.
- [ ] Document the code properly.
- [ ] Explore the possibility of adding more AI models.
